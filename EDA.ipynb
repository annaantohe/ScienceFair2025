    "\n",
    "* Data comes from two back-to-back windows: **Mar 12–Apr 11, 2016** and **Apr 12–May 12, 2016**.\n",
    "* Daily sleep totals are **missing** for the first period (the file isn’t there), so daily sleep data mostly comes from **Apr–May**.\n",
    "* Heart-rate participants are stable (14–14 across periods), but still a **small crowd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data quality + completeness (why this matters)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Heart rate wear time** (how long devices were worn each day) varies a lot by person and day.\n",
    "  Fewer hours worn ⇒ more gaps ⇒ harder to estimate things like “resting” heart rate.\n",
    "* **Uneven sample sizes**: 35 have activity, but only 15 have HR. That makes HR-based findings **less reliable**.\n",
    "* **Missing files** (like daily sleep for the first month) limit comparisons across the full 2-month span.\n",
    "* **Real-life noise**: caffeine, stress, sickness, or a missed night wearing the device can mess with patterns.\n",

    "* **Activity patterns** (steps and intense-minutes) across **many people** and **both months**.\n",
    "* **Sleep minutes at the minute level** for **~25 people**, including bed/wake patterns and nightly totals.\n",
    "* **Cross-domain questions** (like “does more activity relate to more sleep?”) are possible, **but only for the overlap groups**. Best case is **12 people** with activity + sleep + heart rate together.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What the EDA suggests (high-level takeaways)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plenty of activity data, limited heart-rate data.**\n",
    "   If your question *needs* heart rate, expect small samples and cautious conclusions.\n",
    "2. **Decent sleep coverage, but split across two formats** (minute-by-minute and daily totals) and **missing daily totals** for the first period.\n",
    "3. **Only 12 people have the full picture** (activity + sleep + heart rate).\n",
    "   That’s your “gold” group for any combined analysis—just remember it’s small.\n",
    "4. **Comparisons across the two months are uneven** because not every file exists for both months.\n",
    "5. **Before fancy modeling**, it’s smart to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Check **per-person coverage** (how many days each person actually wore the device).\n",
    "   * Decide on **inclusion rules** (e.g., “use a day only if ≥12 hours of HR wear time”).\n",
    "   * Align **dates carefully** (sleep that ends on a morning belongs to that day’s HR/activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What analyses make sense next (and what to watch out for)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Activity ↔ Sleep (weekly):** You can group by week per person and compare sleep hours between people with **≥150 “very active” minutes/week** vs. those with less.\n",
    "  Expect **small differences** and **noisy results** unless you restrict to people with many valid weeks.\n",
    "* **Sleep ↔ Heart Rate (daily):** You *can* estimate a next-day “resting-ish” HR by taking a **low percentile** of daytime HR after waking (e.g., 15th percentile).\n",
    "  With only **~12–15 people**, don’t overclaim—report averages, spreads, and p-values, but keep conclusions careful.\n",
    "* **Wear-time checks are crucial.** Low wear time can fake “low HR” or “no steps,” so set a **wear-time threshold** before trusting a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plain-English conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "* You’ve got **lots of activity data**, **pretty good sleep data**, and **much less heart-rate data**.\n",
    "* Only **about a dozen people** have *all three* types of data at the same time, which **limits how strong** any “sleep affects heart rate” or “activity affects sleep” claims can be.\n",
    "* The data is **good for learning and demonstrating methods** (grouping by week, joining datasets, making comparisons), but **not great for proving small effects**.\n",
    "* Be transparent: explain the **small sample for HR**, **missing files** for the first month’s daily sleep, and the need to **filter by wear time**. That keeps your science honest and your results believable.\n"
